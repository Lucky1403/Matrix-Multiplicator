# Matrix-Multiplicator


Overview


This project implements matrix multiplication in Python. It allows users to input two matrices and performs multiplication if the dimensions are compatible. The result is displayed as a new matrix. Matrix multiplication is only possible if the number of columns of the first matrix is equal to the number of rows of the second matrix.


Features


⚫ Accepts matrix dimensions from the user.

⚫ Fills matrices with user-provided values.

⚫ Checks if matrix multiplication is possible based on input dimensions.

⚫ Performs matrix multiplication and displays the result.

⚫ Handles invalid inputs gracefully by notifying users when multiplication is not possible.


Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

⚫ Python 3.x installed on your system.


How to Run

1) Clone this repository or download the project files.

2) Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.

3) Run the Python program using the following command:   python MatrixMultiplicator.py

4) Follow the on-screen prompts to:

⚫ Enter the dimensions of the first matrix (rows and columns).

⚫ Enter the dimensions of the second matrix (rows and columns).

⚫If the dimensions are valid for multiplication, you will be prompted to input the values for each element of the matrices.

5) The result of the matrix multiplication will be printed to the console.
